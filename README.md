#### Auger
[Auger](https://github.com/laffra/auger) is a Python library that auto generates unit tests to aid in the development of any Python project. It currently cannot be installed with pip, and so it has been included in my repository and imported into my code. 

#### Dominate
[Dominate](https://github.com/Knio/dominate) is a Python library that allows you to generate HTML code strictly with Python, eliminating the need to use a seperate templating language.

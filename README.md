# Sample-Sorter
A small commandline tool that you can use to sort music samples from the [Converse Sample Library](https://www.conversesamplelibrary.com/).

## Usage
Running `converse.py` with a set of Converse Sample files in the `/source files` directory, seperated by Converse Pack, will sort the files into the `/sorted files` directory.

## Testing
Unit tests have been implemented using the [Auger Testing Framework](https://github.com/laffra/auger). The unit tests have already been created under the `scripts/tests folder`, but can be recreated by running the `scripts/testdata/test.py` with a subset of sample files present in the `scripts/testdata/source files`, seperated by Converse Pack.
